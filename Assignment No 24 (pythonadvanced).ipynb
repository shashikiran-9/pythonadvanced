When the Python interpreter reads a file, the name variable is set as main if the module being run,      or as the module's name if it is imported\n"

    "     Reverse Polish notation (RPN) is a method for conveying mathematical expressions without the use of separators such as          brackets and parentheses. In this notation, the operators follow their operands, hence removing the need for brackets to        define evaluation priority. The operation is read from left to right but execution is done every time an operator is            reached, and always using the last two numbers as the operands. This notation is suited for computers and calculators          since there are fewer characters to track and fewer operations to execute.\n"
