    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "     Inhertence is nothing but reusing the code of parent class by the child class. Similary when a child class inherits its        properties from multiple parent classes thisbscenario is called Multiple Inheritence. Mulitple inheritance is a feature of      some object-iriented computer programming languages inwhich an object or class can inherit features from more than one          parent object or parent class. It is distinct from single inheritance, where an object or class may only inherit from one      particular object or class.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "     Pseudoprivate attributes are also useful in larger frameworks or tools, both to avoid introducing new method names that        might accidentally hide definitions elsewhere in the class tree and to reduce the chance of internal methods being              replaced by names defined lower in the tree. If a method is intended for use only within a class that may be mixed into        other classes, the double underscore prefix ensures thar the method won't interfere with other names in the tree,              especially in multiple-inheritance scenarios.\n",
