    "Ans:\n",
    "     True Random Numbers are true physical values while pseudo-random numbers are generated internally by a program . Latter is      considered good enough as they have sort of uniform distribution. Pseudo random numbers are generated by computers using        an algorithm (there are many) and a seed (either chosen by the user or, sometimes, clock time). They are not strictly          random as, if you start with the same seed and same algorithm. A truly random number, on the other hand, is completely          unpredictable. There is no way to generate a series of truly random numbers via computer; the usual ways are flipping          coins, throwing darts, rolling dice and other physical processes.\n"
