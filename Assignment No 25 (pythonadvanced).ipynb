In addition, the legend displays information about the points that are          currently hovered over or, if none are hovered over, about the last points shown on the plot.

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "     The 180-day moving average is represented as a line on charts and represents the average price over the past 180 days. The      moving average can give traders a sense regarding whether the trend is up or down, while also identifying potential            support or resistance areas. A moving average (MA) is a stock indicator that is commonly used in technical analysis. The        reason for calculating the moving average of a stock is to help smooth out the price data over a specified period of time      by creating a constantly updated average price. A simple moving average (SMA) is a calculation that takes the arithmetic        mean of a given set of prices over the specific number of days in the past; for example, in this case over 180 days.\n",
