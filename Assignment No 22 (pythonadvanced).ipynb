    "Que1. What are the benefits of the built-in array package, if any?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "     Arrays represent multiple data items of the same type using a single name. In arrays, the elements can be accessed              randomly by using the index number. Arrays allocate memory in contiguous memory locations for all its elements. Hence,          there is no chance of extra memory being allocated in case of arrays.  This avoids memory overflow or shortage of memory        in arrays.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Lists and  NumPy Arrays usually are much better alternatives. That's also the reason why rarely people knows Python has a      built-in Array type.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     However, when something is restricted, it must bring some benefits. That is the so-call \"trade-off\". In this case, Python      Array will have a smaller size than Python List. This is demonstrated below.\n",
