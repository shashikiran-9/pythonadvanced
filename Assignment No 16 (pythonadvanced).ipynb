    "Que1. What is the benefit of regular expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "     Regular Expressions, also knows as regex or regexp, are match strings of text such as particular characters, words or          patterns of characters. It means that we can match and extract any string pattern from the text with the help of regular        expressions. it helps the programmers to Write less and cleaner code. it also avoids multiply use of if/else statements.        Regular expressions are a powerful feature of any language and solve a particular class of problems extraordinarily well.      They cancbe used to validate user input, extract relevant data from a string, or even modify a string based on its              contents.\n",

    "     Python's regular expression library is called \"re\" and is based on Perl's regular expression engine,which is pretty much        an industry standard now.\n",
